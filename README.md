i used webSocket for Real-time handeling with a very simple backend(server.js)

i used modal for add and edit form because of simpler access and used the same form for both(so its a reusable form)

there are three tabs(routes) one is just a simple home screen, one is a store front page and the other one is and admin panel

used Redux for Adding, Updating and Deleting products in the admin page

used a index.d.ts file for product types

thank you for your time
